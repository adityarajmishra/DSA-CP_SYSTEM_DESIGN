Introduction
------------

Competitive Programming is a sport of coding where participants solve well-defined algorithmic and computational problems within a specified time limit. A strong grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms is crucial for excelling in this domain. Additionally, knowledge of System Design becomes essential when tackling real-world problems that require scalable and efficient solutions.

This repository aims to bridge the gap between DSA and CP, providing a holistic approach to problem-solving. It covers fundamental algorithms, data structures, and advanced topics such as dynamic programming, graph theory, and more. Moreover, it delves into System Design principles, guiding you through designing scalable and performant systems.

Features
--------

-   DSA Modules: Explore well-documented modules covering a wide range of data structures and algorithms. Each module includes explanations, examples, and implementation details.

-   CP Challenges: Engage in a collection of curated competitive programming challenges with solutions and explanations. Sharpen your problem-solving skills by tackling these diverse problems.

-   System Design Concepts: Learn key concepts in system design, including scalability, fault tolerance, and load balancing. Understand how to architect systems for real-world scenarios.

-   Interactive Learning: Leverage interactive code snippets and Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning. Experiment with code in a controlled environment.
